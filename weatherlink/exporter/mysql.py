This module includes an exporter that can take WeatherLink records imported or downloaded and export them to a MySQL
database. Though the schema used can be customized, the schema in mysql.sql is recommended. Additionally, this exporter
can be used to calculate daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and all-time summaries, and to analyze rain events.
