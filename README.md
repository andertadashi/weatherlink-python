# WeatherLink Python Library

This library provides Python tools for importing WeatherLink ".wlk" files into memory for use, importing WeatherLink
web download data into memory for use, and exporting WeatherLink records to various formats. Currently, only the
Vantage Pro2 console is supported as a data source, and only MySQL is supported as a destination. Future potential 
improvements include:

* Direct console connection and download, manipulation
* Export to JSON
* Export to CSV
